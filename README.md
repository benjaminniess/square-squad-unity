### What is SQUARE SQUAD? ###

SQUARE SQUAD is a local multiplayer game where you basically have to catch a small orange square that pops somewhere in the arena and bring it back to a base. You'll have to collect as many orange squares as possible to be the best but you'll have to be careful of the ennemies and of other players that'll try to steal you the square by dashing on you!

You'll find some bonus that also pop anywhere in the arena. Some of them will help you, some others will bother your opponents.

You can play up to 4 players using gamepads and if necessary, one player can use the keyboard.

### Technically ###

This is a Unity game that has been developed for desktop devices (Windows, Mac os, Linux). It works with any PC controller/PS4 controllers and one player can user the keyboard.

### Graphics ###

Graphics are not my cup of tea. If this is yours and you want to make it look like something, please let me know!
